                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>The background colors of this website are very bright and hard to look at, whiile the images and their backgrounds are a bad contrast.</li>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>The website does not have much uniformity to the background colors or spacing, making it very difficult to follow along.</li>
                    <li><b>Allignment: </b>The allignment on the page is probably the worst part of the website, as all of the elements are misalligned and do not line up with any of the images at all.</li>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>The proximity of the paragraph elements of the page are different between different elements. The uniformity of the proximity is very disorganized.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="listthings">
                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>The background of the website is all white and the contrast of headers for items to purchase is black, making it easy to see what to pay attention to.</li>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>The website's design is repeated on every page and the uniformity is identical throughout, making it easy to follow along.</li>
                    <li><b>Allignment: </b>The images all line up with each other, along with the headers of said images. The subtext even aligns with the headers, makign it easy to see what text goes together.</li>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>The proximity of the images is evenly spaced, both between photos and between the margins of the page itself. The text and headers all have uniform proximity and margins,
                        making it very simple and slick in design.</li>
