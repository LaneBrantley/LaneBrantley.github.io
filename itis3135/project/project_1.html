        <h2 class="ph2">Page Design: </h2>
        <p>Home Page: Will host most of what the user will see during their interaction. Will have some data entry so it will require data validation via JS.</p>
        <p>Terms of Service: Will host the TOS for the company.</p>
        <p>About us: Will display the information about the company/client.</p>
        <p>Support: Will have basic information about issues and links for more specific things.</p>
        <p>Contact Support: Will be various ways to contact us for support.</p>
        <p>Forums: Will be a space for users to post about issues they've had. No data validation as it is simply text, no need to validate.</p>
        <p>Manual: Basic Information on how to use the website and what it's for.</p>

        <h2 class="ph2">Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h2>
        <p>For the Home Page, there will need to be interactivity between the page and JavaScripts,
            both to validate the input and to provide feedback on the input. The forums will also need JavaScript
            to fill in the page based off of what the user entered.
